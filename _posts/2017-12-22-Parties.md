The x-axis is the margin by which Trump won the state in the 2016 election, while the y-axis is the Senator's lifetime DW-Nominate score on dimension 1. Think of this score as an ideology metric, an indication of the liberal-ness of their voting record in Congress. Lower means more liberal (-1 is most liberal score); higher means more conservative (+1 is most conservative score).
